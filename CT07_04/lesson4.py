# Lesson 4 - List Variables I

## Recap 1: While Loop
# Task: Code a New Year Countdown timer. 
# Example: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, HAPPY NEW YEAR!

# 1. The countdown timer will count one by one and stop at 1.
# 2. After 1, the program will say Happy New Year
# 3. Use the time library to pause 1 seconds between each
#    number

# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# import time
# n = 10
# while n !=0:
#     time.sleep(1)
#     print(f"{n},")
#     n -=1
# else:
#     print("happy new year!")


# ## Task 1: List of planets
# **Task: Create a list of 8 planets in the solar system**

# **Task 1a**:
# Create a list of 8 planets in the solar system.
# (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)

# **Task 1b**:
# You have conquered Mars, **rename** Mars to a name of
# your liking

# **Task 1c**:
# 1. You have decided Pluto is a planet again, **add** Pluto
#    into the list
# 2. You created an artificial planet between Earth and
#    Mars called "Lalaland". **Insert** the planet in
#    correctly into the list.

# **Task 1d**:
# You launched a war againts Jupiter and destroyed it,
# **delete** Jupiter from the list

planets =["Mercury", "Venus","Earth","Mars","Jupiter","Saturn","Uranus","Neptune"]
planets[3] = "hersheys"
print(planets[3])
planets.append("Pluto")
planets.insert(3,"Lalaland")
print(planets)
planets.pop(5)
print(planets)

# Task 2
# 1. Write a for loop and print out all the names of the
#    planets
# 2. If name == "Earth", print "<planet name> : this is
#    my home"
# 3. If name == "Mars" (or changed name), print
#    "<planet name> : I conquered this"
# 4. If name == "Lalaland", print
#    "<planet name> : I created this"
for i in planets:
    print(i)
